Attempt number 4,731 to play with AI-assisted coding

## Goals
1. Create a project template that can be used in future AI-assisted coding sessions
2. Create a dev environment where no frameworks or libraries are required, aside from the OS and dotnet libraries (Which are available on most OSes)
3. Create an environment that is self-validating, that is, has a series of tests that verify that it is working correctly and discussions with the AI will be around which tests are failing and/or which tests to add for new functionality

## Status
Still working on getting modularity in-place. Have decided to use "processing a sparse jagged string array" to be the default functionality, as so much can be done with this as a base and modifying. No tests added.
Thought it'd be fun to add Obsidian as a templated documentation tool.

**The idea is that I should only need to write functions. No other framework or deployment cruft**
